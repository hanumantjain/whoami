          Iâ€™ve broken more things than Iâ€™ve built â€” and thatâ€™s exactly how I learned to build them right.

          Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold" style={{ color: primaryColor }}>Hanumant Jain</span> â€” a full-stack developer and cloud enthusiast passionate about building scalable, user-centric digital solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold a Master's in Computer Science from The George Washington University and a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Pune University. My journey into tech has been hands-on and curiosity-driven, from exploring cloud computing and DevOps to designing full-fledged web applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, Iâ€™m working as a Student Project Assistant at GWU, where Iâ€™m improving accessibility and maintainability of research platforms using React, JavaScript, and modern front-end practices. My past experiences include developing real-world solutions like <span style={{ color: primaryColor }} className="font-semibold">MedCompass</span>, a voice-based patient follow-up platform built with Flask, Twilio, and MongoDB, and leading the creation of a <span style={{ color: primaryColor }} className="font-semibold">Web-Based Shoe Store</span> using React, Redux, and PostgreSQL.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether itâ€™s backend APIs, front-end UX, or DevOps automationâ€”I thrive on turning complex problems into clean, efficient code. ðŸš€
